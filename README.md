# Project Name

Football Maker is a place, where can you check your best football teams, watch how they play and bet matches.

## General info

App let us to create account and try to win money by betting on soccer matches. They are randomly generated, and the
players' skill determines the result of the match and the amount of winnings. The application allows us to view each
team as well as each player, a summary of the number of goals scored, and the history of the games. The user has his own
profile in which he can view his previous wins or losses. He can also edit his login details and profile picture. The
football teams data is completely artificial. I'm not a football fan :)
